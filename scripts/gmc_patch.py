"""Two fixes to GMC 1.0.0 in game/addons/mpf-gmc (downloaded, not in git), applied idempotently.

1. GMC's poll thread parses whatever bytes the socket holds as whole lines. MPF's "settings" message at connect
is large (every adjustment with its value labels), so a read can end inside it: GMC then parses half a
message, `JSON.parse_string` returns null, `json.error` raises a script error and the BCP thread stops.
Nothing MPF sends after that is handled: no sounds, no music, no callouts (slides queued before may show).
The patch keeps the unfinished end of a read and prepends it to the next one.
2. GMC looks keys up in gmc.cfg [keyboard] by their layout label only, so on AZERTY the number row (which
needs Shift for digits) and "/" never match. A key not found by label is now also looked up by its physical
position on a US keyboard.
Upstream (mpf-gmc main, 2026-10) has the same code. setup.py, run.py and the Docker entrypoint call patch(); it does nothing once applied.

    python scripts/gmc_patch.py        # patch now; prints what it did
